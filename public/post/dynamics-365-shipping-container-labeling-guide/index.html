Although the industry has been numbering and bar coding trade items for a number of years, the biggest emerging problem in the supply chain is logistic unit labeling.</p><p>With the migration to more and more automated scanning in warehouses and distribution centres, it is imperative that suppliers and their logistics providers ensure 100% scannability of all bar codes which will bring mutual benefits to all trading partners. Printing and applying a good quality bar code label that complies to industry standards and which is scannable by all trading partners’ costs no more than printing and applying a bar code label that doesn’t scan.</p><p>This document and its recommendation should be read in conjunction with other GS1 technical guidelines as well as retailer specific documentation all of which can be accessed and downloaded from their respective websites.</p><h2 id=the-importance-of-logistic-pallet-labels>The Importance of Logistic (Pallet) Labels</h2><p>The use of the logistic label incorporating the Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) by all parties in the supply chain, from manufacturers to transporters, distributors and retailers, is seen to be inevitable for the identification and tracking of pallets and other forms of logistic units. The purpose of the GS1 logistics label is to uniquely identify specific information about the pallet clearly and concisely in a standard format, to facilitate the process of moving products through the supply chain quickly and efficiently.</p><p>Industry Business Benefits of GS1 Logistics LabelLogistics Units are identified with a number that is unique worldwideGS1 standards are global and apply through the entire supply chain, from raw materials supplier to manufacturer to distributor/wholesaler to end user/retailer.Provides a link with bar coded information on a logistics unit and the information that is communicated between trading partners via electronic business transactions.Use to identify contents of pallets, including stock data, use-by-dates etcContributes to efficient management of stock rotation at a glanceSaves costs by doing it onceAvoids multiple label types (industry standard)Faster receiving, quick turnaroundImproves data integrity – use by date and quantity fieldsStock rotation based on use by datePallet tracking from vendor to retailer can assist product recallsWorks in conjunction with a Dispatch Advice – Advanced Shipping Notice (ASN)SSCC can be used for both inter and intra-company transactions.</p><p><figure><img src=/svg/loading.min.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=https://nashome-image-bucket.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/Images/D365LabelingGuide/2.png alt=image title=image class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption>image</figcaption></figure></p><p>Fig 1: Example of Numbering & Bar coding Labelling Hierarchy</p><h2 id=logistic-pallet-label-requirements-for-the-retail-industry>Logistic (Pallet) Label Requirements for the Retail Industry</h2><p>The GS1 Logistics Label can typically have many different formats. The SSCC is the only mandatory piece of information that must be contained on the label itself as ideally the information flow, which accompanies the physical flow of goods, is communicated between trading partners by EDI.</p><p>In practice, however, fully automated communication channels, which make it possible to rely exclusively on electronic files for retrieving information on the movements of goods, are not always available. In this situation there may be a requirement to add additional information to the logistics label to facilitate the process of the logistic units through the supply chain.</p><p>The purpose of the GS1 logistics label is to provide information about the unit to which it is fixed, clearly and concisely. The core information on the label should be represented both in machine (bar code) and human readable form. There may be other information, which is represented in human readable form only.</p><h3 id=what-can-go-wrong--common-pitfalls>What can go wrong? – Common Pitfalls</h3><p>It is imperative that suppliers and logistics providers ensure 100% scannability of all barcodes.

In Dynamics AX the Pallet ID is most used for this.</p><p>The SSCC acts as a “reference key” which can be stored in a computer system to which information can be added and shared amongst trading partners as the logistic unit moves throughout the supply chain. This unique “license plate” provides the opportunity to track and trace logistic units in the supply chain.</p><p>Scanning the SSCC marked on each logistic unit allows the physical movement of units to be individually tracked and traced by providing an information flow. It also opens up the opportunity to implement a wide range of applications such as cross docking, shipment routing, automated receiving etc.</p><p>The SSCC is used to uniquely identify goods on the way from sender to final recipient, and can be used by all participants in the transport and distribution chain.</p><p><figure><img src=/svg/loading.min.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=https://nashome-image-bucket.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/Images/D365LabelingGuide/5.png alt=image title=image class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption>image</figcaption></figure></p><p>Figure 3: The Use of the SSCC throughout the supply chain.</p><h3 id=allocating-an-sscc>Allocating an SSCC</h3><p>The SSCC is a unique, non-significant, eighteen-digit number which is assigned by the company constructing the logistic unit. It remains the same for the life of the logistic unit. The SSCC is encoded in a GS1-128 Bar Code and is represented by the Application Identifier (AI) 00.</p><p>When assigning an SSCC, an individual SSCC must not be reallocated within one year of the shipment date from the SSCC assignor to a trading partner.</p><p>How you allocate an SSCC depends on the length of your assigned GS1 Company Prefix.

The same standards are communicated to third party providers both at contract time and by the use of training packages, if necessary. Visual aids are encouraged in factories, warehouses etc to impart SSCC label standards, especially positioning of the labels.</p><p>With many automated and manual labeling systems check scanning controls can be purchased as part of the system, providing a level of automated bar code quality checking and control. These systems incorporate a check scanner at the front of the label printer so that as each label is printed the bar code is scanned to check quality. If a fail to read occurs the printer can print void on the erroneous label and re-print. After multiple failures i.e. 2 or 3, the unit will stop and raise an alarm.</p><h4 id=considerations>Considerations</h4><ul><li><p>Automate the data sources to simplify printing and reduce the need for data entry.</p></li><li><p>Label design tested and sent to GS1 testing service for its verification report</p></li><li><p>Document processes</p></li><li><p>Train staff to visually</p></li><li><ul><li>check the pallet label and position applied</li><li>scan label barcodes to ensure readability</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Incorporate checks for</strong>Correct Bar code symbology (GS1-128)Label placementLabel verificationLabel Defects</p><h4 id=visual-checklist>Visual Checklist</h4><p>Does the data encoded in the pallet label bar codes match the product on the pallet eg</p><ul><li>GTIN</li><li>Batch number (if applicable)</li><li>Quantity</li><li>Date code information, eg. best before or use by date</li></ul><p>The pallet labels applied to the pallet must contain the same SSCC. Pallet labels should not be placed over two separate cartons. Pallet labels should be placed on the outside of the stretch-wrap. Determine if any white lines running vertically through the black lines of the bar code that may hinder the bar code from scanning are evident.</p><h4 id=audits>Audits</h4><p>It is recommended to perform a compliance audit of the labels coming from each factory, warehouse and third party provider every quarter. Results should be reported back as percentage compliance and the issues found highlighted, together with photos, if necessary.</p><h4 id=training>Training</h4><p>It is imperative that anyone that is required to print or apply pallet labels understand</p><p>the industry requirements. Training and documentation is widely available.</p><h4 id=use-of-kpis>Use of KPIs</h4><p>Establish performance metrics as part of the pallet quality checking procedures. This could be plotted graphically by warehouse upon feedback from trading partners.</p><p>The data should be circulated to all factories and warehouses including third party logistics providers, each week with any relevant comments. Provide all of the raw data obtained to help find solutions to particular issues. Include the overall trend of performance for the last twelve months</p><p>Communicate progress to factory and warehouse managers at regular operations meetings to ensure the focus is maintained on the importance of achieving this and other key supply chain standards.</p><h4 id=third-party-3pl-logistic-service-providers>Third Party (3PL) Logistic Service Providers</h4><ul><li>What role/service are they providing</li><li>Are they applying labels</li><li>Have you incorporated them into your logistic unit labeling requirements</li><li>What label application and quality control process do they have in place</li><li>Are they scanning any part of the label prior to dispatching goods</li><li>What is their label printer cleaning and maintenance process</li></ul></div><div class=post-footer id=post-footer><div class=post-info><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-mod><span>本文于 2020-03-18 更新</span></div><div class=post-info-license></div></div><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-md><span><a class=link-to-markdown href=https://www.nashome.cn/post/dynamics-365-shipping-container-labeling-guide/index.md target=_blank>阅读原始文档</a></span></div><div class=post-info-share><span><a href=javascript:void(0); title="分享到 微博" data-sharer=weibo data-url=https://www.nashome.cn/post/dynamics-365-shipping-container-labeling-guide/ data-title="Dynamics 365 Shipping Container Labeling Guide"><i class="fab fa-weibo fa-fw"></i></a><a href=javascript:void(0); title="分享到 百度" data-sharer=baidu data-url=https://www.nashome.cn/post/dynamics-365-shipping-container-labeling-guide/ data-title="Dynamics 365 Shipping Container Labeling Guide"><i class="loveit it-baidu-fill"></i></a><a href=javascript:void(0); title="分享到 Evernote" data-sharer=evernote data-url=https://www.nashome.cn/post/dynamics-365-shipping-container-labeling-guide/ data-title="Dynamics 365 Shipping Container Labeling Guide"><i class="fab fa-evernote fa-fw"></i></a></span></div></div></div><div class=post-info-more><section><span class=tag><a href=https://www.nashome.cn/tags/dynamics365/><i class="fas fa-tag fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Dynamics365</a>&nbsp;
